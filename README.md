Don't actually use these notes as a study guide! I'm only a student, i'm self taught and these notes probably have many mistakes. 

Feel free to check them out but i'm just creating this repo so that I can have access to my notes from anywhere.

If you spot any mistakes in my notes feel free to create an issue.
